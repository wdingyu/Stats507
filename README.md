## Stats507
This is a github repository which I will used to share code and notebooks in Stats 507 and finish the problem set 6.

The primary page for this problem set is available at [Here](https://jbhender.github.io/Stats507/F21/ps/ps6.html).
### [PS2_Q3](./PS2_Q3.ipynb)
This is my code from PS2, Question 3. This code focus on using Pandas to read, clean, and append several data files from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES. Specifically, we focus on the demographic and dentition datasets from 2011-2018. We extract the columns that we are interested in and transform them into appropriate format. As the datasets are provided by the series of year, the code will also combine the datasets based on demographic and dentition data.

The purpose of this code is to clean the dataset and prepare for the further analysis.
